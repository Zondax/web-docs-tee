## Overview

- Reference boards selection and initial prototyping. As an example, we are initially
  considering the following models:
  - Model A: MCIMX6UL-EVKB: i.MX6UltraLite Evaluation Kit by NXP
  - Model B: USB Armory Mk-II
  - Model C: Colibri iMX6ULL by Toradex
  - Model D: Advantech WISE-710

- Define applicable toolchains ( Rust, C/C++, etc.)
- Development process: Define CI and Testing strategy
- Demonstrate feasibility for the selected hardware
