## Overview

- Reference boards selection and initial prototyping. As an example, we initially
  considered the following models:
  - Model A: MCIMX6UL-EVKB: i.MX6UltraLite Evaluation Kit by NXP
  - Model B: USB Armory Mk-II
  - Model C: Colibri iMX6ULL by Toradex
  - Model D: Advantech WISE-710

- Define applicable toolchains ( Rust, C/C++, etc.)
- Development process: Define CI and Testing strategy
- Demonstrate feasibility for the selected hardware

In the sections below we listed each part of this Milestone and the
links to their respective test.

## Item 1

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | :------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | We will select at least two hardware alternatives (from different providers) that will be used in our proof-of-concept implementation. |  |  |

We selected the following boards:

| Number | Deliverable         | Vendor   | Link |
| ------------- | :------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1.     | STM32MP157F-DK2 | ST   | [:page_facing_up: Product Page](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32mp157f-dk2.html) |
| 2.     | 8MMINILPD4-EVKB | NXP  | [:page_facing_up: Product Page](https://www.nxp.com/part/8MMINILPD4-EVKB#/) |

The criterias we used for the selection is described in [this](../technical/10.HardwareSelection.md) section.

## Item 2

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | :------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2. | Basic framework and minimal implementations for each selected board to demonstrate feasibility. |  |  | 

As part of the implementation we used *Yocto* to develop a custom linux distribution for
each board containing essential dependencies that our trusted application
needs. This also reduces the number of possible vector attacks, as the number of tools and services, our distribution contains are minimal. 
Refer to this [section](../technical/30.BSP/30.intro.mdx) for further information about setting-up the basic framework to build 
our custom linux-distribution and how to run it on each supported device.

In [this](../testing/xtests.md) section you can find further instructions on how to test the basic optee
framework that comes as part of our custom linux distribution.

:::info
[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)  is a framework to create custom linux distributions.
