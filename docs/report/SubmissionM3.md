## Integration and Documentation

### Overview

- Integration with Kusama validation node infrastructure
- Integration and basic fuzzing of the signing service
- Documentation and guidelines recommending a set of validator good practices
- Ledger Nano S provisioning application (Given that this will be a technical app, we will provide instructions on how to sideload it and will not be submitted for publication in Ledger Live) - NOTE: This aspect is subject to research outcomes and may not be necessary. As discussed with Jeff Burdges, it is possible that there is no need for external interaction in the case of session keys.)

### Deliverables

1. An end-to-end proof of concept of a Kusama signing hardware/software stack.
2. Ledger Nano S TEE key provisioning app (NOTE: This aspect is subject to research outcomes and may not be necessary. As discussed with Jeff Burdges, it is possible that there is no need for external interaction in the case of session keys.)
3. Corresponding unit and integration tests (including fuzzing)
4. Documentation
