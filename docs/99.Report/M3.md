## Overview

- Integration with Kusama validation node infrastructure
- Integration and basic fuzzing of the signing service
- Documentation and guidelines recommending a set of validator good practices
- Ledger Nano S provisioning application (Given that this will be a technical app, we will
  provide instructions on how to sideload it and will not be submitted for publication in
  Ledger Live) - NOTE: This aspect is subject to research outcomes and may not be
  necessary. As discussed with Jeff Burdges, it is possible that there is no need for external
  interaction in the case of session keys.)

| 2.     | Ledger Nano S TEE key provisioning app (NOTE: This aspect is subject to research outcomes and may not be necessary. As discussed with Jeff Burdges, it is possible that there is no need for external interaction in the case of session keys.) |      |       |

During the development of Milestone 1, it was recognized that private session keys could be generated sefely without any kind of external key provisioning.
Instead, TEEs can generate keys and operators can register the public part of these keys using their controller keys.

For this reason, and to simplify the operation process this items was resolved in a much more efficient way that does not required a specialized provisioning tool.

## Item 3

## Item 4

| 4.     | Corresponding tests |      |       |     |

Given the hardware based nature of this project, several integration steps require manual configuration and verification of the hardware, nodes, etc.
This will be presented during an on-site workshop
