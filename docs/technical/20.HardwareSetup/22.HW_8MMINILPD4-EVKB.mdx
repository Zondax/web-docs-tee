Using this device is very simple. Connect:

-   Ethernet
-   Connect a USB cable to the ST-Link port
-   Power supply
-   plug-in the SD Card in the board slot.

## Setting DIP switches

In this project, we will use SD cards for the images.

For this reason, it is important that you confirm that boot switches are set correctly.

| MicroSD |      Setting       |
| ------- | :----------------: |
| SW1101  | `0110` `1100` `10` |
| SW1102  | `0001` `1010` `00` |

## Detecting serial ports

When you plug the USB-serial cable, it will create serial ports in your host computer.

You can recognize with ports have been detected by running:

```text
> sudo dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] printk: console [tty0] enabled
[    6.444493] cdc_acm 11-1:1.1: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
[  560.568721] cdc_acm 9-3:1.1: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
[26531.500870] usb 9-3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[26531.503855] usb 9-3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB1
```

This board creates **TWO** serial ports (UART).

- port 0: (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) M4 core
- port 1: (`/dev/ttyUSB1`) A53 core

so in order to connect to the Linux related port use:

```bash
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB1
```
