A Trusted application runs in a TEE (trusted execution environment) that is isolated from the normal REE (Rich execution environment) where the normal OS is running. To talk to a TA, you need a host application (HA) that executes in the non-secure world (REE = Rich execution environment).

[Hello-rustee](https://github.com/Zondax/hello-rustee) demonstrates how we can run both a host and trusted apps using OPTEE and Rust in these devices. 
In order to simplify trusted app development we have created a set of tools to facilitate not only compilation but also emulation (QEMU) and [testing](../../testing/hello_rustee.md). 

## Overview

It is a simple echo program, where the client sends a message to the trusted app
which received the message and sends it back to the client. Although it
is simple, it allows to verify basic but important optee framework
functionalities:
- Open a session to our Trusted Application(TA)
- Send commands to the TA
- Send data to the TA validating we can write buffers and send them to
  the TA through the Optee framework
- The TA process commands correctly thanks to a well functioning Optee
  framework.
- The TA is able to received the data coming from the external world(REE) and send data to the external world in a secure way.

Ensuring that the client or REE application can open sessions to Trusted
Applications is important as any optee program requires this
functionality as well as a proper communication where both the secure and non-secure worlds
can exchange data flowlessly.

Below we can see part of the code that our tee-base framework calls to start the application.  
The function attributes no_mangle tells the compiler to use the function
name "run" instead of changing it. The **extern C** attribute indicates the compiler to use C abi
to make this function callable from C.. 
sent to the TA:

```Rust
#[no_mangle]
#[cfg(not(feature = "ci"))]
pub extern "C" fn run() -> u32 {
    env_logger::init(); //can use any logger impl if you want

    /* ****************
        Place your logic from here....
        You could do it directly in this crate or separate it out to another crate so it's easier to test
        Below is some example code
    ****************** */
    let msg = "been to trusted and back";
    info!("[TEE] << {}", msg);

    assert_eq!(logic::echo(msg.as_bytes()), Ok(true));
    0
}
```

We have below the **invoke_command** function, that processes data
comming from the REE world. It uses our custom bindings for safety and simplicity, this means that this function is called by another rust function
as a result there is not a **no_mangle**  or **extern C** attributes.

```Rust
fn invoke_command(_cmd_id: u32, param_types: u32, parameters: &mut [TEE_Param; 4]) -> u32 {
    let mut params = Parameters::from_raw(parameters, param_types);

    // This check would depend on the opretion defined by cmd_id
    // We might decide to limit the params to be only two, an input and output
    // slice.
    let expected_param_types = TEE_PARAM_TYPES(
        ParamType::MemRefInput as u32,
        ParamType::MemRefOutput as u32,
        ParamType::None as u32,
        ParamType::None as u32,
    );
    if param_types != expected_param_types {
        error!("[ERROR] Bad parameters");
        return Error::BadParameters as _;
    }

    let mut imemref = unsafe {
        params
            .0
            .as_memref()
            .expect("this is safe, the type was previously checked")
    };
    let mut omemref = unsafe {
        params
            .1
            .as_memref()
            .expect("this is safe, the type was previously checked")
    };

    /* **********
        Place your logic from here...
        You could do it directly in this crate or separate it out to another crate so it's easier to test
        Below is some example code
    ************ */

    //let's ignore the cmd_id since we only accept 1 command
    //which is the echo command

    let input = imemref.buffer();
    let out = omemref.buffer();

    if input.len() > out.len() {
        return Error::BadFormat as _;
    }

    out.copy_from_slice(&input[..input.len()]);

    0
}
```

The hello-rustee app also serves as a template that developers can use
to build new applications as its structure is know by our build system,
making it easy to deploy new applications.

```
The framework directory contains the TEE-BASE framework that as described
in this [section](../../technical/60.Framework/61.TeeBase.md), contains the bootstrapping C code that calls the user code
in *REE* and *TEE*, which is written in Rust.

this app
