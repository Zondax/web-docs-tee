## Prerequisites

- We assume you are using Ubuntu. Other OSs (MacOS/Windows) are not formally supported.

- Install tmux

   ```bash
   sudo apt install tmux
   ```

- We recommend install oh-my-tmux [here](https://github.com/namtzigla/oh-my-tmux)

   ```bash
   cd
   git clone https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
   ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
   cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .
   ```

## Run

:::warning Remember you need tmux for this step
:::

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
make dev
```

This should launch a tmux session with 4 panes:

<img src="/img/qemu-tmux.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

- **Top pane**: QEMU
- **Left pane**: Rich execution environment (`telnet localhost 54320`)
- **Right pane**: Secure execution environment (`telnet localhost 54321`
- **Bottom pane**: Bitbake

You can start the emulator by typying `c <ENTER>` in the top pane.

You will then see the "machine" booting. After a few seconds, you will see a login prompt on the left pane.

:::tips tmux Tips

- If you installed oh-my-tmux, your prefix will be `<CTRL>+A` otherwise, it will be `<CTRL>+B`

- To close everything use `<PREFIX> + &`, the answer `y`

## Development

Let's assume you are working on the hello-rustee example. This is located in the `hellorustee` recipe.

```bash
make workspace qemu hellorustee
```

This command will checkout the source code of the recipe in `sources/hello-rustee`.

You can now start working there (even switch branches or commit changes!)

### Build your changes

Go to the bitbake window (bottom pane) and build the recipe:

```bash
bitbake optee-hellorustee
```

This will trigger a minimal image rebuild

## Testing

Let's say that you want to test your changes without having to restart the emulator. :)

In this case, you can mount the local filesystem inside the emulator.

:::tip 
You should have already started the emulator and booted the image!
:::

In the left pane, login as root and type:

```bash
cd /mnt
```
