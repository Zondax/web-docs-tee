This section describes the tools that we include in this project to facilitate the development and testing of applications
that should be compiled for any of the supported targets.

## Clone the repo

First of all, we need to clone the images repo en `cd` into it.

```bash
git clone --recursive --branch master https://github.com/Zondax/buildroot-zondax.git
cd buildroot-zondax
```

## Build the image

To build the image, please run the following command:

```bash
make zondaxtee_qemu_defconfig; make
```

### Run

Start the emulator:

```bash
make qemu
```

You will then see the "machine" booting. After a few seconds, you will see a login prompt, in development images
you can use `root` as user and no password is set.

:::tips Tips
- To exit qemu, you can use CTRL+A X
- If you want to get access to the TEE console, you can use `telnet 127.0.0.1 54321`
:::

once you login, you can run your app (`hello-rustee`) and see the outputs both in REE and TEE

_REE_
```text

### Applying changes

You can find the source code of the demo app in `external/hello-rustee` (git submodule pointing to the repository)

In this example, please edit a file, for instance:
```bash
vim external/hello-rustee/TEE/lib/src/optee.rs
```

Look for the line `trace!("Invoked command..");` and replace that with `trace!("Hi!!!!");`

If you modify the source code, there are some handy make targets that help rebuilding specific packages:

```
make hellorustee-dirclean; make hellorustee-build; make hellorustee-install
make
```

These are applicable to any package, i.e. `make {PACKAGE}-build` would work

Now you can run qemu again, and test hello-rustee and you will see your changes appearing! :tada::tada::tada:
