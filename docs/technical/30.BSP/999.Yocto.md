:::warning ATTENTION
These steps are **NOT** required and may result in broken build if not used properly
:::

### Build or pull the container with the build environment

To retrieve the latest published container image

```bash
make docker
```

### Pull latest repo manifest

To retrieve the latest published container image

```bash
make manifest
```

This command wraps `repo` tool and fetches the latest changes and updates of
the working files in your local environment, essentially accomplishing git fetch
across all Git repositories listed in [default.xml](https://github.com/Zondax/zondbox-manifest)
manifest.

### Adjusting existing recipe

- If you're familiar with Yocto build system and want to run all Yocto-specific
  commands manually, you can login into the docker container using this command:

```bash
make shell <target> # target: qemu, qemu8, dk2
```

Then follow steps described in this [manual](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/TipsAndTricks/Patching_the_source_for_a_recipe)

- If you're not familiar with Yocto, you can use existing wrappers which
  is supposed to make simplify things:

```bash
make workspace <target> <recipe-name>
```

This will fetch the sources for the recipe and unpack them to a
`shared/zondbox-distro/build/workspace/sources/<recipename>` directory and
initialise it as a git repository if it isn't already one.

You can make any changes to the sources, make new commits, switch branches/remotes etc.

When you want rebuild the images, the sources from your workspace will be
used instead the `SRC_URI` value specified in recipe.

#### Creating new recipe

To create a new example recipe:

```bash
cd shared/zondbox-distro/meta-zondax
mkdir recipes-example
cd recipes-example
mkdir bbexample
cd bbexample
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DynamicDevices/meta-example/master/recipes-example/bbexample/bbexample_1.0.bb
```

The recipe will then be picked up by bitbake and you can build the recipe.

Login into docker container using `make shell <target>` command, then:

```bash
bitbake bbexample
```
