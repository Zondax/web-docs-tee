The next step is to burn the image on the SD Card which should be at least 4 GB.

### Balena Etcher

A quick alternative to store images in SD cards is to use Balena Etcher.

Please install Balena Etcher from [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

:::warning
There is a bug in the latest version (1.7.1).
We recommend using version 1.7.0, please download from here: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/tag/v1.7.0
:::

Flashing to the SD card is very simple:

<img src="/img/etcher.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

1. Select the image
2. Select the output device where your SD is located
3. Click Flash

<img src="/img/etcher2.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

4. Wait until the process finishes.

5. Done!! :tada:
