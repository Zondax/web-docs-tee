The next step is to burn the image on the SD Card which should be at least 4 GB.

### Balena Etcher

A quick alternative to store images in SD cards is to use Balena Etcher.

Please install Balena Etcher from [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Flashing to the SD card is very simple:

<img src="/img/etcher.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

1. Select the image
2. Select the output device where your SD is located
3. Click Flash

<img src="/img/etcher2.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

4. Wait until the process finishes.

5. Done!! :tada:

<img src="/img/etcher3.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>

### Manual process

if you prefer to follow a manual process.

Depending on your setup, it is possible that `/dev/mmcblk0` is not the correct
device, instead of `/dev/mmcblk0` it is possible that you need to use something like `/dev/sd?` if you are using card readers, etc. 
In order to be sure how the card is prefixed on your setup, run the following command

```sh
df -h
```

Now we can flash the SD Card using DD.

:::warning
before to use the command dd, please unmount all the partitions associated to SDCARD.

```sh
sudo umount `lsblk --list | grep mmcblk0 | grep part | gawk '{ print $7 }' | tr '\n' ' '`
```

### STM32MP157F-DK2

Just pass the path to the dk2 raw image to DD:

```bash
cd shared/images/dk2
sudo dd if=FlashLayout_sdcard_stm32mp157f-dk2-optee.raw of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=8M conv=fdatasync status=progress
```
