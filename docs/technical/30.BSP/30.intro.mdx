The following instructions will explain in detail how to use yocto in order to build SD Card images for each board.
The images contain the secure application for signing and key generation using a trusted execution environment based on the OPTEE standard.

Board supported:

- STM32MP157F-DK2 (Add link to hardware description and connections)
- 8MMINILPD4-EVKB (Add link to hardware description and connections)

## Preconditions

- We assume you are using Ubuntu. Other OSs (MacOS/Windows) **are not** formally supported.
- Install Docker [Link](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- The build process is time consuming and will require all your computer resources, we assume you are using the computer exclusively to build the
  image.

## Common steps

First clone our entry point project that contains some scripts that take care of getting the packages and recipes to build an image for any of the supported boards:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Zondax/tee-images.git
cd tee-images
make manifest force
```

Once the manifest is updated we can start building the linux-base operating system that would run on the board you selected.

It is important to mention that this step will build a full linux image containing everything is needed to run our optee-base application.

It can take a lot of resources and time depending on your computer.
