The following instructions will explain in detail how to use buildroot in order to build SD Card images for each board.
The images contain the secure application for signing and key generation using a trusted execution environment based on the OPTEE standard.

Board supported:

- STM32MP157F-DK2 [Instructions here](../HardwareSetup/HW_STM32MP157F-DK2)
- 8MMINILPD4-EVKB [Instructions here](../HardwareSetup/HW_8MMINILPD4-EVKB)

## Preconditions

- We assume you are using Ubuntu. Other OSs (MacOS/Windows) **are not** formally supported.
- Install Docker [Link](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- The build process is time consuming and will require all your computer resources, we assume you are using the computer exclusively to build the
  image.

## Common steps

First clone our entry point project that contains some buildroot configuration and packages to build an image 
for any of the supported boards:

```bash
git clone --recursive --branch master https://github.com/Zondax/buildroot-zondax/
cd buildroot-zondax
```

We can start building the linux-base operating system that would run on the board you selected.

It is important to mention that this step will build a minimal but functional linux image containing 
everything is needed to run our optee-base application.

It can take a lot of resources and time depending on your computer.
