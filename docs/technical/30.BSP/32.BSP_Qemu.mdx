## Build

There are two possible targets

- `qemu`: for ARMv7
- `qemu8`: for ARMv8

While all examples will concentrate on ARMv7, the other targets are available too.

Build the image is as simple as running:

```bash
make build qemu
```

This may take a while the first time.

It will prepare an image similar to the OS that is being deployed in devices.
