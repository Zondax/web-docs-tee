:::info
This may take a while the first time. It'll take ~2 hours, depending on your computer power
:::

## Clone the repo

First of all, we need to clone the images repo en `cd` into it.

```bash
git clone --recursive --branch master https://github.com/Zondax/buildroot-zondax.git
cd buildroot-zondax
```

## STM32MP157F-DK2

To start building a `dk2` we need, first of all, to generate some keys. Let's do it with the following commands:

```bash
make genkeys
```

:::warning
Please, back up your keys located in `./keys`. We recommend backing up all the directory (there should be 3 subdirectories, `optee_keys`, `tfa_keys` and `uboot_keys`). 
It's going to be really critical in some following steps so, please, don't lose this backup.
:::

After the success of this commands, we can build the whole image with one command:

```bash
make zondaxtee_stm32mp157_dk2_defconfig
make
```

This command will launch a docker container where the build process will
take place. The build process would take a while depending on your system
capabilities, but generally it can take up to 1 or 2 hours.
Once the process is completed the full image is located in

```bash
buildroot-st/output/images/sdcard.img
```

## 8MMINILPD4-EVKB

To start building a `8MMINILPD4-EVKB` image we first need to generate `optee` keys:

```bash
make genkeys
```

Then, we just need to run one command, as the key generation is going to be done inside the build process:

```bash
make zondaxtee_imx8mmevk_defconfig
make
```

Once the process is completed the full image is located in

```bash
buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img
```
