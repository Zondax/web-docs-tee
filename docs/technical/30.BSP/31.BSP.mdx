## STM32MP157F-DK2

To start building a _DK2_ image run the following command:

```bash
make dk2
```

This command will launch a docker container where the build process will
take place. The build process would take a while depending on your system
capabilities, but generally it can take up to 1 or 2 hours.
Once the process is completed the full image is located in

```bash
buildroot-st/output/images/sdcard.img
```
