The next step is to burn the image on the SD Card which should be at least 1 GB.

### Balena Etcher

A quick alternative to store images in SD cards is to use Balena Etcher.

Please install Balena Etcher from [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Flashing to the SD card is very simple:

<img
  src={require('../../assets/etcher.png').default}
  alt="drawing"
  width="640"
/>

1. Select the image
2. Select the output device where your SD is located
3. Click Flash

<img
  src={require('../../assets/etcher2.png').default}
  alt="drawing"
  width="640"
/>

4. Wait until the process finishes.

5. Done!! :tada:

<img
  src={require('../../assets/etcher3.png').default}
  alt="drawing"
  width="640"
