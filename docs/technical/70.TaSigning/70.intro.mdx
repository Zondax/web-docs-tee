The optee framework requires that TA applications are signed. By default
optee-os comes with a [dummy](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/tree/master/keys) key that is used to sign optee applications,
tests and examples. If a user wants to sign the TA with a custom key, they
have to pass to optee-os the public key to use in order to validate
TA signatures and sign the trusted application following the algorith
described [here](https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/trusted_applications.html#signing-of-tas)
:::info
Automatic TA signing happens [here](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/ta/arch/arm/link.mk#L109)

## Enabling offline signing of TAs

Our yocto configuration enables offline signing by default. In order to
disable offline signing, you have to comment out the following lines in
our template configuration [file](https://github.com/Zondax/tee-images/blob/ta_signing/shared/configs/local.conf.sample#L39)

```bash
export ENABLE_TA_SIGNING = "1"
export TA_CUSTOM_PUBKEY = "${TOPDIR}/../../keys/optee/optee_pub_key.pem"
export TA_CUSTOM_PRIVKEY = "${TOPDIR}/../../keys/optee/optee_priv_key.pem"
```

:::note
If there is a previous build, the file that should be updated by
commenting out the lines described above is the one located in
`tee-images/shared/zondbox-distro/build/conf/local.conf`
:::
We recommend to keep offline signing enable by default if your
application is intended to run in production, but if you are in the
development stage, you can disable it.

:::warning
Offline signing causes the optee tests and examples to fail with
the following error message:

```bash
E/TC:? 0 ldelf_init_with_ldelf:126 ldelf failed with res: 0xffff000f
```

where this error code means:

```
0xffff000f = TEEC_ERROR_SECURITY
```

This happens because they are
signed using the default signing key that is part of optee-os, however
optee was configured to use a different public key to validate the signature.

## Generating keys

There is a script that can be used to generate keys for offline signing:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Zondax/tee-images.git # if it has not been cloned before
cd tee-images
./shared/tools/optee/gen_keys.sh
```

The keys are generated in the `shared/keys/optee/` sub-directory. It is
advisable to make a security copy of those keys.

## Building image with signed TAs

Once the keys have been generated and offline signing is enabled, we can
start to build an image that will contain our application properly
signed using our custom keys. The build instructions remain the same as
the signing process is done by our optee [framework](https://github.com/Zondax/tee-base/blob/master/ta/src/Makefile#L28)
