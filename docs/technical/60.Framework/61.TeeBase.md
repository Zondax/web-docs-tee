## Prelude

In order to aid future developments and to make use of the crate system of rust, we have split the project in 2 repositories:

* The [application](../40.Development/42.SubstrateService.md)
* The framework (or [tee-base](https://github.com/Zondax/tee-base))

In this document we'll be talking about the latter.

## What is `tee-base` ?

In short `tee-base` is a rust tee application bootstrapping framework.

What does this mean in practice is that the repository hosts 4 main components:

* Rust crates with utilities and bindings to the OPTEE API

* C projects that act as "trampolines" for the rust applications

* CI testing scripts

This allows the CI worker to execute the script after setting up the environment, 
so the script will take care of listening for the test outputs and generate a simple
report for the CI job.

* A template for new apps

This can be used to very quickly setup a new project with the required structure to use `tee-base`. 
We make use this structure in both the project and [the example hello world app](../40.Development/41.HelloRustee.md).

## What are these rust crates?

The rust crates present in the framework can be divided in 2:

* The `zondee-teec` crate for the host application

* The `zondee-utee` crate for the trusted application

### zondee-teec

This crate provides abstractions and utilities to interact with the OS's OPTEE API,
so that it's possible to more idiomatically create sessions and interface with the 
trusted application, like invoking commands in a much more ergonomic way compared to the 
raw C bindings, which are still accessible thru the crate.

### zondee-utee

This crate is the counterpart to `zondee-teec`, providing abstractions and utilities to interact with the OS's OPTEE API but from the TEE (trusted execution environment).

Among other things, this also means providing bindings to the official panicking function.

Other features include:

* A `GlobalAllocator` to make use of dynamic allocation via the official OPTEE allocation API

* A `CryptoRng` implementation making use of the official OPTEE randeom generation API

* A `Log` implementation to allow use of the `log` crate and custom log handlers
