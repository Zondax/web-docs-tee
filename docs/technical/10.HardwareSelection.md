### Selection process

We are evaluating and working with multiple architectures and manufacturers at this moment. We are taking into account several factors including but not limited to:

-   Security ( Trustzone, HAB support, Secure Memory )
-   Logistics ( Market availability, Lead Time )
-   Support ( Existing BSPs, Technical Support, Documentation )
-   Robustness ( Temperature range, Power supply range, SBC/Carrier Format)
-   Peripheral ( Ethernet connection, USB connection )
-   Price

We have contacted each manufacturer, evaluated their support process, received technical documentation. In many cases, we have acquired the product to run internal tests.

As a reference we can provide a list of some of the devices we are currently working with:

#### Why some devices are prioritized?

After analyzing and testing a wide range of devices, we noticed a few common themes:

-   BSP quality issues
-   Inadequate form factor for datacenter applications: We believe ethernet support is a critical requirement.
-   Market availability problems: devices are still not available, stocks were low and supply chain is not clear.

With respect to software layers, we had a look at different design alternatives. Taking a pragmatic long-term support perspective, we decided to use a extremely minimal Yocto+OPTEE image for the initial implementation.

While there are interesting opportunities in the bare metal / RTOS space, we consider them too experimental. Moreover, we prefer to rely on projects with a substantial community to ensure long term maintenance. This means, relying on extensive testing, CVE availability, strong community, etc.
