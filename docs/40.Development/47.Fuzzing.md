Security is paramount when it comes to storing sensitive data, that's also the whole reason to adopt a technology like OPTEE.

When it comes to code, we do not simply wish to rely on our best effort to prove that the application is safe, that's why we make use of tools to aid us in making sure our application is robust even with malicious or unexpected inputs.

That's why we decided to use modern fuzzing so we can rely on these technologies to test for all kinds of inputs and edge cases that we can't easily reason about.

## Prerequisite

- Only Linux x86_64 or macOS x86_64 as supported

- Git LFS

- Have `make`, but also `cargo`, [rust nightly toolchain and a C++ compiler with C++11 support](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz#installation)

## Run

Open a new terminal and navigate to the cloned repository

Then, install `cargo-fuzz` with `fuzz_dep` Makefile target and start fuzzing!

```bash
make fuzz_dep fuzz
```

:::note
Compilation may get stuck on `curve25519-dalek` for even 10 minutes before continuing
:::

:::tip
Subsequent runs only need to specify `fuzz` as make target, without `fuzz_dep`
:::

The tool will start fuzzing the application, both with random and mutated inputs, this is done to explore the various branches of execution of the program and detect application crashses.

For more information please see [libFuzzer documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).

In case of an application crash the fuzzer will stop and point out the input that caused the crash, as well as the stacktrace that lead to the crash and also steps how to rerun the exact same input to verify the issue or, alternatively, verify that the issue has been fixed.

### Run with AFL

We also support using [AFL (American Fuzzy Loop)](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) via [afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs).

Simply open up a terminal and

```bash
make afl_fuzz_dep afl_fuzz
```

:::tip
As with libFuzzer, `afl_fuzz_dep` is only necessary for the first run
